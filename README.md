DevOpsFoundation: Hands-On
Comments added using the default mac zsh terminal. 

Things learned so far:
1. I understand the zsh default macs terminal which is also an extension of the bash or using the default terminal on VSC helps you modify,edit, change directory of whatever that is present in my git repository can be done simply by using these two terminals.

2. Commands learned so far:
git clone git@github.com:modfaiz/devops-foundation-.git [Learnt in the linkedinlearning]

then the typical cloning,
git clone [paste the git link from the repo]

and then you get into the repo automatically. 

3. You could view anything like using git log, git show, change stuff in the repo, git push just by using these tterminals.
